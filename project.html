        <h2 class="projects_subheading">What is LifeBot?</h2>
        <p class = "projects_mainText">The LifeBot project aimed to revolutionize emergency response capabilities, particularly in scenarios such as cardiac arrests, by providing swift access to life-saving equipment in indoor environments where traditional response times may be compromised, specifically in indoor settings where defibrillators are often scattered and difficult-to-locate.
        <h2 class="projects_subheading">How was this accomplished?</h2>
        <p class = "projects_mainText"> The software development involved several key components, starting with the controller. A PI (Proportional-Integral) controller was implemented to dynamically adjust motor PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) commands, allowing the robot to respond proportionally to differences between desired and actual wheel speeds. The main control loop calculated wheel angular rates from encoder data and adjusted PWM signals to match the vehicle's speed with the target speed. Real-time monitoring was facilitated through the Arduino IDE's serial monitor and plotter, providing insights into wheel velocities. To address discrepancies in wheel speeds due to motor deficiencies, an additional PI system was implemented to minimize errors between the left and right wheel speeds, ensuring accurate trajectory control.</p>  
        <p class= "projects_mainText">For navigation, the LifeBot utilized ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) packages. The SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) package built a 2D map and determined the robot's position using a laser scanner (RPLIDAR) and an odometry system. The NAV2 package created a cost map, calculated the lowest cost path to the target location, and sent navigation instructions to ROS2 Control. ROS2 Control integrated a differential drive controller, standardizing control and state information and enabling fast data transmission. Communication between the Arduino and Raspberry Pi was managed via ROS2, with internet communications handled by SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) to offload computationally intensive tasks to a base station. Serial communications connected the Arduino to motors, encoders, and sensors, facilitating real-time data exchange and control commands.
        </p>
        <p class = "projects_mainText"> The proposed solution features a lightweight chassis with a mechanically optimized hinge mechanism. This chassis is mounted on an existing frame using nut and bolt fasteners, allowing for easy installation and removal. PLA plastic was chosen as the material for its cost-effectiveness and structural integrity, while the hinge mechanism ensures easy access to the AED device in emergencies.</p>  
          <p class= "projects_mainText">The chassis underwent an iterative design process using SolidWorks for Computer-Aided Design (CAD), which was crucial in refining and optimizing the design. Initial sketches and models were created to conceptualize the mounting solution. These preliminary designs were evaluated and modified to address potential issues such as weight distribution, ease of access, and structural integrity. Each iteration involved adjustments to the geometry and material properties to enhance the overall performance and functionality of the chassis.
          </p>
          <p class= "projects_mainText">The chassis underwent rigorous testing through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to confirm its ability to withstand expected mechanical stresses. SolidWorks built-in simulation tools were employed to conduct various simulations, including stress analysis using Von Mises criteria, displacement analysis, and strain analysis. The results demonstrated the chassis's robustness and reliability: the Von Mises stress ranged from 9.644e+01 to 6.376e+06 N/m², the maximum displacement was 2.530 mm, and the equivalent strain ranged from 3.77e-08 to 2.125e-03. These findings confirmed the chassis’s ability to endure operational mechanical loads while maintaining the AED device securely in place and ready for immediate deployment.

          <p class = "projects_mainText">The Sensor Suite V3 project focuses on redesigning and fabricating a modular, compact sensor mounting solution optimized for autonomous vehicle applications. This redesign aims to enhance functionality by incorporating accurate sensor positioning, integrated waterproofing (meeting at least an IPX4 rating), and a localized power delivery system to reduce cabling complexity. The suite is designed to house a range of sensors, including multiple LiDARs with vibration-dampening mounts, short- and long-range cameras, and mounting points for GNSS and scoring antennas.</p>
          <h2 class="projects_subheading">How was this accompished?</h2>
          <p class = "projects_mainText">The project began with a full mechanical redesign focused on modularity and compactness, using CAD tools to ensure precise sensor alignment and ease of assembly. Each sensor was carefully positioned to maximize field of view and minimize blind spots, with vibration-dampening mounts implemented for the LiDAR units to improve data fidelity. Waterproofing was achieved through gasketed enclosures, sealed connectors, and the use of corrosion-resistant materials, meeting at least an IPX4 rating. A localized power delivery system was integrated directly into the suite to simplify the wiring architecture and reduce the number of long cables routed throughout the vehicle. Custom PCBs and watertight connectors were used to centralize power distribution and improve reliability. Mounting brackets for GNSS receivers and scoring antennas were added as modular components to allow flexible positioning and future upgrades.</p>
          <h2 class="projects_subheading">What was the result?</h2>
          <p class = "projects_mainText">The final Sensor Suite V3 significantly improved robustness, ease of installation, and system reliability. The integrated waterproofing successfully protected electronics during outdoor testing in wet conditions. The localized power system reduced cable length by over 50%, minimizing signal noise and easing maintenance. The modular design allowed for quick sensor swaps and streamlined debugging, which accelerated development cycles. Overall, the redesign enhanced the vehicle’s sensing capabilities while making the suite more maintainable, scalable, and competition-ready.</p>

            <p class = "projects_mainText"> The robot was built using a Raspberry Pi Pico W, encoder-equipped DC motors, and servo-actuated mechanisms. Mechanical components were designed and iterated in SolidWorks, with motion simulation validated using linkage software. Control was achieved through PI-based speed regulation and encoder-based odometry. The arm mechanism was optimized for reach and torque, and all major parts were 3D printed or laser-cut.

            <p class= "projects_mainText">Integral to the arm's operation is the gearbox mechanism, comprising gears, rods, and motors. The gearbox transmits rotational motion and torque from the DC motors to facilitate smooth and efficient movement of the arm's gripper mechanism. Additionally, the incorporation of a stepper motor enables precise control and manipulation of objects, enhancing the arm's functionality and usability. Through iterative design iterations and rigorous testing, the project successfully developed a practical and efficient solution. CAD software was utilized to refine and optimize the arm's geometry, ensuring structural integrity and mechanical robustness. Furthermore, simulation techniques, such as stress analysis and displacement analysis, were employed to validate the arm's performance under operational loads, confirming its reliability and effectiveness in assisting individuals with grip strength limitations.
