              <p class = "projects_mainText">The Queens Racing Team's goal was to design a lighter, detachable rear subframe for their Formula SAE car to enhance acceleration and control. This new subframe needed to reduce weight while still providing necessary mounting points for the powertrain, rear suspension, and rear wing.<a href class="read-more-link">Click here to read more</a></p>

                <h2 class="projects_subheading">How was this accomplished?</h2>
                <p class = "projects_mainText"> The final design developed for the detachable subframe for the Queens Racing Team's open-wheel car consists of a trapezoidal prism with two slanted sides and no cross-bracing. This design choice focused on reducing material usage and overall weight while maintaining structural integrity. The subframe is constructed entirely from 4130 steel tubing, chosen for its lightweight yet durable properties. The wide top and narrow base of the trapezoidal shape distribute forces evenly, reducing stress on any single point. The absence of cross-bracing simplifies the design and reduces weight further, making the subframe easier to manufacture while still providing sufficient support for the car’s components.</p>  
                <p class= "projects_mainText">To ensure durability and performance, the subframe’s mounting points for the rear suspension, powertrain, and rear wing are carefully positioned. The mounting points for the rear suspension are retained in their original locations to ensure compatibility and ease of integration. The connection points to the car’s main frame utilize removable frame bungs, inspired by a design from California Polytechnic State University, which allow for easy detachment and reattachment, facilitating maintenance and repairs.

                <h2 class="projects_subheading">What was the result?
                </h2>
                <p class= "projects_mainText">The final design achieved a significant weight reduction, bringing the subframe's weight down from 29.6 kg to 7.7 kg, thus enhancing the vehicle's acceleration and control. The use of 4130 steel tubing provided the necessary strength to withstand the forces encountered during racing. The simplified design, free from cross-bracing, was not only lighter but also easier and more cost-effective to manufacture. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations confirmed that the subframe could handle the required forces, ensuring it met all safety and performance criteria. The detachable subframe design successfully balanced weight reduction, durability, and manufacturability, aligning with the project's goals and constraints.
